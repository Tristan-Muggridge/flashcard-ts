# flashcard-ts
Creating a CRUD flashcard application which interacts with both Firestore for a persistent repo for user data, but also local storage.

Objective: Create a CRUD application using Firebase as a backend. I've not used firebase before but have heard many good things about it, and so
 being inspired by applications like Memrise and Anki, I decided to create a flashcard application that would levergae the firebase product!

Technologies Used:
- React
- TypeScript
- Vitest (Vite Test)
